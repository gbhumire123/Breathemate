# BreatheMate â€“ AI-Powered Lung Health Tracker

## Overview
BreatheMate is a full-stack application designed to help users monitor and improve their lung health. It integrates a React frontend, a Spring Boot backend, and a Python-based machine learning model to provide insights into breathing patterns and potential risks.

## Features
- **Frontend**:
  - User authentication (Login and Register).
  - Dashboard for recording and uploading breathing audio.
  - Journal for logging daily thoughts and activities.
  - Report page with visualizations of prediction history.

- **Backend**:
  - REST APIs for user management, file uploads, journal entries, and prediction history.
  - PostgreSQL database integration.
  - Logging and error handling.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Audio processing and feature extraction using Librosa.
  - Predictions using a pre-trained model.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Chart.js.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL.
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Librosa, Scikit-learn.
